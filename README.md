# FileZipper

This is a simple program that creates an archive of files and/or directories
using a default compression.\
What I am most proud of in this edition is scaling of the whole window so that
it always occupies 1/4 of the screen width and 1/3 of its height approximately.\
The frame is kept in the same aspect ratio (4:3) regardless of the screen size
and resolution. All of the components are also properly scaled (almost all).\
\
The program has also been complimented with many most basic features and
functions which were omitted in the lesson. That does not mean it is a complete
application similar to commercial products.\
It is simply a presentation of what I have learned so far and am capable of, what I can create on my own in addition
to what has been written in the lesson.\
For example, one of the key features which has not been implemented is unpacking or unzipping an archive. The reason
is simple: I preferred to focus on and devote time to additional things that came
to my mind. This program would not have been used for everyday work anyway.
It is just a showcasing tool.
